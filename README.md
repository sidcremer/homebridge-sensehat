# homebridge-sensehat

A Homebridge plugin for a Sense HAT equipped Raspberry Pi

The real work is performed by two small Python programs: leds.py is used for controlling the Sense HAT's LEDs and sensors.py for reading the temperature, humidity and air pressure sensors.

Fork of srob/hombridge-sensehat additing suuport for WS281B led strips connected to the Pi through the GPIO pins that aren't used by the Sense HAT.

## Installation
1.	Install Homebridge using `npm install -g homebridge`.
2.	Install this plugin `npm install -g homebridge-sensehat`.
3.  Install this plugin `npm install rpi_ws281x`.
4.	Update your configuration file. See below for an example.

## Notes
1. script_path (with trailing /) should point to the directory where the two python scripts are located.
2. The user under which homebridge runs (often homebridge) needs to be able to use the Sense HAT API, the easiest way to do this is to make the user a member of the groups video, i2c (and others, to be documented).

## Configuration

Example configuration (polling intervals default to indicated seconds):

```json
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "SenseHat",
      "name": "Sense Hat",
      "script_path": "path to python scripts",
      "led_interval": 2,
      "sensors_interval": 10
    }
  ]
```
